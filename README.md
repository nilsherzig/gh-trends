Big thanks to [isboyjc/github-trending-api](https://github.com/isboyjc/github-trending-api/) for providing the data.

## TODOs

- [ ] proxy and cache data cdn
- [ ] check XSS (and things like that) protection (github and the github-trending-api project would have to let it through to become a problem, but you never know)
- [ ] add own data source
- [ ] allow sharing of filter lists
- [ ] add cross language positive filters ("search")
